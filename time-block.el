;;; Commentary:
;;

;; This package requires [`ts.el`](https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el) to
;; handle time parsing.
;;
;; Download `time-block.el` to somewhere on your `load-path' and
;; load with `(require 'time-block)`.
;;
;;;; Usage
;;
;; To use this package it's necessary to do two things: define time
;; blocking groups and define time blocked commands.
;;
;;;;  Time Blocking Groups
;;
;; Customize the variable `time-block-groups'.  An example of a groups definition is below.
;;
;; (setf time-block-groups '((workday . ((1 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
;;                                       (2 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
;;                                       (3 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
;;                                       (4 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
;;                                       (5 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))))))

;;;; Defining Time Blocked Commands
;;
;; Commands are only time-blocked if they're defined.  This is done using
;; the `define-time-blocked-command` macro, which behaves similarly to
;; `defun`.  After the lambda list, it has a list describing blocking and
;; blocking messages.  This is composed of a symbol (a key in
;; `time-block-groups') a block message, and an optional override prompt
;; (if present, the command will ask if you'd like to override the block
;;     using `yes-or-no-p').  An example is shown below.
;;
;; (define-time-blocked-command my/start-elfeed ()
;;                              (workday "You have decided not to check news currently."
;;                                       "You have decided not to check news currently.\nStill start elfeed?")
;;   "Start `elfeed'.
;;
;; Time blocked according to `time-block-groups'."
;;   (interactive)
;;   (elfeed))
;;
;;;; Advising commands to be time-blocked
;;
;; Commands can also be advised to use timeblocking.  This works for
;; simpler commands, and as a bonus, can make it harder to access the
;; commands when blocked.  Overall, the arguments for `group`,
;; `block-message` and `override-prompt` are as above.  Consider the
;; following example.
;;
;; (time-block-advise my/elfeed-block-advice 'elfeed workday "You have decided not to check news currently."
;;                    "You have decided not to check news currently.\nStill start elfeed?")
