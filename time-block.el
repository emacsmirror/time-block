;;; Commentary:
;;

;; This package requires [`ts.el`](https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el) to
;; handle time parsing.
;;
;; Download `time-block.el` to somewhere on your `load-path' and
;; load with `(require 'time-block)`.
;;
;;;; Usage
;;
;; To use this package it's necessary to do two things: define time
;; blocking groups and define time blocked commands.
;;
;;;;  Time Blocking Groups
;;
;; Customize the variable `time-block-groups'.  An example of a groups
;; definition is below.
;;
;; (setf time-block-groups '((workday . ((1 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
;;                                       (2 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
;;                                       (3 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
;;                                       (4 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
;;                                       (5 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))))))
;;
;; This variable is an alist of names (keywords) to group definitions.  A
;; group definition is an alist from days of the week (as numbers, Sunday
;; = 0/7, etc.) to lists of start/stop pairs (times in "HH:MM" form).
;;
;; It is also possible to ignore time blocking on holidays.  This is
;; globally set using the `time-block-skip-on-holidays-p' variable.
;; This defaults to nil, which does not ignore blocking on holidays.
;; If set to t, time blocking will be ignored on any holiday.  It may
;; also be set to a regular expression or a list.  Holidays which
;; match either representation will cause time blocking to be ignored.
;;
;;;; Defining Time Blocked Commands
;;
;; Commands are only time-blocked if they're defined.  This is done using
;; the `define-time-blocked-command` macro, which behaves similarly to
;; `defun`.  After the lambda list, it has a list describing blocking and
;; blocking messages.  This is composed of a symbol (a key in
;; `time-block-groups') a block message, and an optional override prompt
;; (if present, the command will ask if you'd like to override the block
;;     using `yes-or-no-p').  An example is shown below.
;;
;; (define-time-blocked-command my/start-elfeed ()
;;                              (workday "You have decided not to check news currently."
;;                                       "You have decided not to check news currently.\nStill start elfeed?")
;;   "Start `elfeed'.
;;
;; Time blocked according to `time-block-groups'."
;;   (interactive)
;;   (elfeed))
;;
;;;; Advising commands to be time-blocked
;;
;; Commands can also be advised to use timeblocking.  This works for
;; simpler commands, and as a bonus, can make it harder to access the
;; commands when blocked.  Overall, the arguments for `group`,
;; `block-message` and `override-prompt` are as above.  Consider the
;; following example.
;;
;; (time-block-advise my/elfeed-block-advice 'elfeed workday "You have decided not to check news currently."
;;                    "You have decided not to check news currently.\nStill start elfeed?")
;;
;;;; Manually advising commands to be time-blocked
;;
;; Commands can also be manually advised.  This can be done to prevent
;; only certain cases from happening.  For instance, I use the following
;; code to delay myself from editing my emacs configuration during the
;; workday.
;;
;; (defun my/buffer-sets-around-advice (orig name)
;;   "Check if NAME is 'emacs', if so, follow time blocking logic before calling ORIG (`buffer-sets-load-set')."
;;   (unless (and (string= name "emacs")
;;                (time-block-group-blocked-p :workday)
;;                (not (yes-or-no-p "You have decided not to edit your emacs configuration at this time.\nContinue?")))
;;     (funcall orig name)))
;; (advice-add 'buffer-sets-load-set :around #'my/buffer-sets-around-advice)
