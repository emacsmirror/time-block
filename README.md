# time-block

A method for blocking access to emacs commands based on time.

## Installation

This package requires [`ts.el`](https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el) to
handle time parsing.

Download `time-block.el` to somewhere on your `load-path` and
load with `(require 'time-block)`.

## Usage

To use this package it's necessary to do two things: define time
blocking groups and define time blocked commands.

### Time Blocking Groups

Customize the variable `time-block-groups`.  An example of a groups definition is below.

```elisp
(setf time-block-groups '((workday . ((1 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
                                      (2 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
                                      (3 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
                                      (4 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))
                                      (5 . (("09:00" . "17:00")))))))
```

### Defining Time Blocked Commands

Commands are only time-blocked if they're defined.  This is done using
the `define-time-blocked-command` macro, which behaves similarly to
`defun`.  After the lambda list, it has a list describing blocking and
blocking messages.  This is composed of a symbol (a key in
`time-block-groups`) a block message, and an optional override prompt
(if present, the command will ask if you'd like to override the block
using `yes-or-no-p`).  An example is shown below.

```elisp
(define-time-blocked-command my/start-elfeed ()
                             (workday "You have decided not to check news currently."
                                      "You have decided not to check news currently.\nStill start elfeed?")
  "Start `elfeed'.

Time blocked according to `time-block-groups'."
  (interactive)
  (elfeed))
```

### Advising commands to be time-blocked

Commands can also be advised to use timeblocking.  This works for
simpler commands, and as a bonus, can make it harder to access the
commands when blocked.  Overall, the arguments for `group`,
`block-message` and `override-prompt` are as above.  Consider the
following example.

```elisp
(time-block-advise my/elfeed-block-advice 'elfeed workday "You have decided not to check news currently."
                                                          "You have decided not to check news currently.\nStill start elfeed?")
```
